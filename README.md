# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning-Methods
This project explores deep learning for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), comparing CNN- and LSTM-based models, including BiLSTM.  We find that BiLSTM improves accuracy on the EMODB dataset, with the best results from a model based on prior work. We also suggest data augmentation and transfer learning to address limited data.
